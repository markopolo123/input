# 99% Uptime

## Question

You are using a service that works 95% of the time.
Assuming you can replicate the service: how many replicas would you need
to reach 99% for all replicas combined (at least 1 online) ?

## Answer

We would need 2 replicas to hit our 99% combined availability target
for the service. This would actually give us 99.75% availability
(1 - 0.05 * 0.05 = 0.9975).
